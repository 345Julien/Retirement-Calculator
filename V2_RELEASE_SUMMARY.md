# Harbor Stone Retirement Calculator - V2.0.0 Release Summary

**Release Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Status**: ✅ Complete & Tested

---

## 🎯 Overview

Version 2.0.0 addresses 6 critical bugs and UX improvements identified in V1.0.0. This release focuses on fixing functionality issues and enhancing user experience, particularly around liquidity events management and settings persistence.

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Inflation Toggle Functionality** ✅
**Problem**: The "Apply Inflation" toggle button was displayed but not actually controlling inflation calculations.

**Solution**: Updated `Scenario` constructor to accept and use the `inflation_enabled` parameter from the sidebar toggle.

**Files Modified**:
- `app.py` (line ~1202): Added `inflation_enabled=inflation_enabled` to Scenario constructor

**Impact**: Users can now properly toggle inflation on/off in their projections.

---

### 2. **Administration Panel Visibility** ✅
**Problem**: "Show Detailed Calculation Breakdown" was a button that displayed content - not collapsible like debug monitor.

**Solution**: Converted button to collapsible expander using `st.expander()` with `expanded=False` default.

**Files Modified**:
- `app.py` (line ~1905): Changed `st.button()` to `st.expander("📊 Show Detailed Calculation Breakdown", expanded=False)`

**Impact**: Cleaner UI, administration section no longer takes up excessive screen space.

---

### 3. **One-Time Events End Age Display** ✅
**Problem**: One-time liquidity events showed End Age field even though they only occur at Start Age.

**Solution**: 
- Made End Age field optional with helpful tooltip
- Added info message above table: "End Age is only required for Recurring events. For One-time events, only Start Age is used."
- Updated column help text

**Files Modified**:
- `app.py` (line ~535): Added `st.info()` message
- `app.py` (line ~590): Changed End Age to `required=False` with help text

**Impact**: Better UX clarity - users understand End Age purpose and aren't confused by unnecessary fields.

---

### 4. **Cashflow Graph - Negative Events Positioning** ✅
**Problem**: Negative liquidity events (outflows) were appearing on the positive side of the cashflow breakdown graph.

**Solution**: Split liquidity events into two separate traces:
- **Liquidity Inflows**: Positive values (gold color #c9a961)
- **Liquidity Outflows**: Negative values (bronze/brown #8b7355)

Used pandas `.clip()` method to separate positive and negative values.

**Files Modified**:
- `app.py` (lines ~1628-1641): Replaced single "Net Liquidity Events" trace with two traces

**Impact**: Accurate visual representation - outflows now appear below zero line, inflows above.

---

### 5. **Outflow Display in Table** ✅
**Problem**: Confusion about whether outflows should be entered as positive or negative numbers.

**Solution**: 
- Updated amount field help text: "Outflows will be stored as negative values after saving"
- Added caption below table: "Outflow amounts will automatically be converted to negative values when you click Save."
- Validation logic already correctly converts outflows to negative (line ~658-662)

**Files Modified**:
- `app.py` (line ~593): Updated help text
- `app.py` (line ~616): Added caption

**Impact**: Clear guidance for users - enter positive amounts, system handles sign conversion.

---

### 6. **Settings Persistence Across Screens** ✅
**Problem**: Settings like "Enable Monte Carlo" were reset when navigating to/from liquidity events screen.

**Solution**: Stored key settings in `st.session_state`:
- `enable_mc`
- `mc_runs`
- `effective_tax_rate_pct`
- `enable_taxes`

Used session state values as defaults for all sidebar controls.

**Files Modified**:
- `app.py` (lines ~1012-1051): Added session state initialization and persistence for MC and tax settings

**Impact**: Settings now persist across page navigation - better UX and fewer user frustrations.
