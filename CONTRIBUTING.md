## üìù Code Style Guide

### Python Style
- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines
- Use **type hints** for function parameters and return values
- Add **docstrings** to all functions (Google style)
- Keep functions **focused** and **testable**
- Use **descriptive variable names**

### Example Function
```python
def calculate_withdrawal(
    balance: float,
    rate: float,
    frequency: str
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate annual withdrawal amount.
    
    Args:
        balance: Portfolio balance in dollars
        rate: Withdrawal rate as decimal (e.g., 0.04 for 4%)
        frequency: 'Annual' or 'Monthly'
    
    Returns:
        Annual withdrawal amount in dollars
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_withdrawal(1000000, 0.04, 'Annual')
        40000.0
    """
    annual_amount = balance * rate
    if frequency == "Monthly":
        annual_amount *= 12
    return annual_amount
```

### Code Organization
- **Constants** at top of file (UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES)
- **Dataclasses** next
- **Pure functions** (calculations) before UI code
- **UI functions** last
- **main()** at bottom

### Comments
- Use comments to explain **why**, not **what**
- Avoid obvious comments
- Update comments when changing code
- Remove commented-out code before committing
