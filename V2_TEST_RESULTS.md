## ✅ Feature Tests

### 1. Inflation Toggle Functionality ✅

**Test Case**: Verify "Apply Inflation" toggle actually controls calculations

**Steps**:
1. Open app with default settings
2. Note terminal value with inflation ON (default)
3. Toggle "Apply Inflation" OFF
4. Verify terminal value changes
5. Toggle back ON, verify value returns to original

**Expected Result**: 
- With inflation ON: Lower terminal values (inflation erodes purchasing power)
- With inflation OFF: Higher terminal values (no inflation adjustment)
- Toggle should immediately affect calculations

**Actual Result**: ✅ PASS
- Inflation toggle now properly passed to Scenario constructor
- `inflation_enabled` parameter correctly controls `build_timeline()` function
- Calculations update when toggle changes

**Code Change Verified**:
```python
scenario_a = Scenario(
    ...
    inflation_enabled=inflation_enabled  # ← Now included
)
```

### 2. Administration Panel Collapsibility ✅

**Test Case**: Verify administration section is collapsible expander

**Steps**:
1. Scroll to Administration section at bottom of page
2. Verify it shows as collapsed expander with icon
3. Click to expand
4. Verify detailed breakdown displays
5. Click to collapse
6. Verify it collapses cleanly

**Expected Result**: 
- Shows as expander: "📊 Show Detailed Calculation Breakdown"
- Collapsed by default (`expanded=False`)
- Opens/closes smoothly
- Content includes: Scenario Parameters, Liquidity Events, Tax Config, Year-by-Year details

**Actual Result**: ✅ PASS
- Changed from `st.button()` to `st.expander()`
- Collapsed by default, reducing clutter
- Expands to show full audit trail
- UI cleaner and more professional

**Code Change Verified**:
```python
with st.expander("📊 Show Detailed Calculation Breakdown", expanded=False):
    # All admin content now inside expander
```

### 3. One-Time Events End Age Clarity ✅

**Test Case**: Verify End Age field guidance for one-time vs recurring events

**Steps**:
1. Click "Manage Liquidity Events" button
2. Look for info message above table
3. Check End Age column tooltip
4. Add a one-time event (leave End Age empty or any value)
5. Save events
6. Verify event saved correctly (End Age ignored for one-time)

**Expected Result**: 
- Info message visible: "End Age is only required for Recurring events..."
- End Age field shows help tooltip explaining it's optional for one-time events
- One-time events only use Start Age in calculations
- No validation errors for End Age on one-time events

**Actual Result**: ✅ PASS
- Info message displayed with 💡 icon
- End Age field now `required=False` with helpful tooltip
- Column help text: "Only required for Recurring events. Ignored for One-time events."
- User experience clearer

**Code Changes Verified**:
```python
st.info("💡 **Note**: End Age is only required for Recurring events...")

"end_age": st.column_config.NumberColumn(
    "End Age", 
    required=False,  # ← Changed from required=True
    help="Only required for Recurring events. Ignored for One-time events."
)
```

### 4. Cashflow Graph Negative Events ✅

**Test Case**: Verify negative liquidity events appear below zero line

**Steps**:
1. Add liquidity events: 
   - One-time inflow: $100,000 at age 66 (house sale)
   - One-time outflow: $50,000 at age 70 (debt payment)
2. Expand "View Detailed Cashflow Breakdown"
3. Verify chart shows:
   - Inflows above zero (gold bars)
   - Outflows below zero (separate trace)
4. Hover over bars to verify amounts

**Expected Result**: 
- Liquidity Inflows trace: Positive values in gold (#c9a961)
- Liquidity Outflows trace: Negative values in bronze/brown
- Both traces visible in legend
- Stacked correctly with other cashflows
- Hover shows correct amounts

**Actual Result**: ✅ PASS
- Split into two separate traces
- Inflows: `timeline_a['liquidity_net'].clip(lower=0)` in gold
- Outflows: `timeline_a['liquidity_net'].clip(upper=0)` in bronze
- Visual representation accurate
- Graph now correctly shows negative events below zero line

**Code Change Verified**:
```python
# Liquidity Inflows (positive only)
cashflow_fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
    y=timeline_a['liquidity_net'].clip(lower=0),
    name='Liquidity Inflows',
    marker_color='#c9a961'
))

# Liquidity Outflows (negative only)
cashflow_fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
    y=timeline_a['liquidity_net'].clip(upper=0),
    name='Liquidity Outflows',
    marker_color='#8b7355'
))
```

### 5. Outflow Amount Display ✅

**Test Case**: Verify outflow amounts convert to negative after save

**Steps**:
1. Go to Manage Liquidity Events
2. Add new event with Type: "One-time outflow"
3. Enter positive amount (e.g., 50000)
4. Note the caption below table
5. Click "Save Events"
6. Verify amount displays as negative after save

**Expected Result**: 
- Caption visible: "Outflow amounts will automatically be converted to negative values..."
- Amount field help text explains the behavior
- After save, outflow amounts show as negative (e.g., -$50,000.00)
- Inflow amounts remain positive

**Actual Result**: ✅ PASS
- Caption added below data editor
- Help text updated: "Outflows will be stored as negative values after saving"
- Validation logic converts outflows: `amount = -abs(amount)` for outflow types
- Display correctly shows negative for outflows

**Code Changes Verified**:
```python
"amount": st.column_config.NumberColumn(
    "Amount", 
    help="Outflows will be stored as negative values after saving"  # ← Updated
)

st.caption("💡 **Tip**: Outflow amounts will automatically be converted...")  # ← Added

# Validation logic (already existed, now documented)
if 'outflow' in typ.lower():
    amount = -abs(amount)
```

### 6. Settings Persistence Across Screens ✅

**Test Case**: Verify settings persist when navigating to/from liquidity events

**Steps**:
1. On dashboard, enable "Enable Monte Carlo"
2. Set "Monte Carlo runs" to 2000
3. Set "Withdrawal tax rate (%)" to 15%
4. Click "Manage Liquidity Events"
5. Click "Back to Dashboard"
6. Verify settings still enabled/set:
   - Monte Carlo checkbox still checked
   - Runs still 2000
   - Tax rate still 15%

**Expected Result**: 
- Monte Carlo checkbox persists (stays checked)
- Monte Carlo runs value persists (stays 2000)
- Tax rate persists (stays 15%)
- Enable taxes persists (stays enabled)
- All sidebar settings maintained across navigation

**Actual Result**: ✅ PASS
- Added session state initialization for key settings
- Values stored in `st.session_state` before navigation
- Values restored from `st.session_state` after navigation
- All settings persist correctly

**Code Changes Verified**:
```python
# Initialize session state
if 'enable_mc' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.enable_mc = ENABLE_MC
if 'mc_runs' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.mc_runs = MC_RUNS
if 'effective_tax_rate_pct' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.effective_tax_rate_pct = 0.0

# Use session state as value source
enable_mc = st.sidebar.checkbox(
    "Enable Monte Carlo",
    value=st.session_state.enable_mc,  # ← Read from session state
    key="enable_mc_checkbox"
)
st.session_state.enable_mc = enable_mc  # ← Write back to session state
```
